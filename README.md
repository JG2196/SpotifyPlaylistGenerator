**Tunneling:** NGROK (optional)
## Installation

Clone my project via github or

```
  git clone https://github.com/JG2196/BlazorApp1.git
  cd BlazorApp1
```

### Prerequisites

- Spotify Developer account
- Open AI account
- Web tunnel (optional)

### Quick Start

#### Spotify Application

Create a Spotify Application from the developer dashboard https://developer.spotify.com/.

Set the redirect URI path with a path of `/signinauth`, example 'https://playlistgenerator.com/signinauth'. **IMPORTANT** Spotify's security update no longer supports localhost as a redirect URI. To get around this use tunneling services like (NGROK) whilst in development, or an alternative.

Select Web API as the API that the application is using. Continue to create the application.

#### OpenAI Application

Create a new project.

Create a secret key for the application. Make sure to take note of the secret key provided.

Add credits to your application.

#### Configure appsettings.json

Set the secrets, keys, ids and redirect URI.

For the OpenAI Model, select the model that will best fit your needs.

```
{
  "SpotifyWeb": {
    "ClientId": "your_spotify_client_id",
    "ClientSecret": "your_spotify_client_secret",
    "AuthAddress": "https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize",
    "RedirectUri": "your_redirect_uri",
    "Scopes": "your_required_scopes",
    "SignOutUrl": "your_signout_url"
  }
  "OpenAI": {
    "APIKey": "your_openai_api_key"
